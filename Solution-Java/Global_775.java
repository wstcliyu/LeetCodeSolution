    // If A[i] > i + 1, means at least one number that is smaller than A[i] is kicked out from first A[i] numbers, and the distance between this smaller number and A[i] is at least 2, then it is a non-local global inversion.
    // For example, A[i] = 3, i = 1, at least one number that is smaller than 3 is kicked out from first 3 numbers, and the distance between the smaller number and 3 is at least 2.
    // If A[i] < i - 1, means at least one number that is bigger than A[i] is kicked out from last n - i numbers, and the distance between this bigger number and A[i] is at least 2, then it is a non-local global inversion.
